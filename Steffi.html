                                <p>Start of Semester</p>
                                <p> The parts required to build the automated hydroponices system were being discussed and approved with our Project Supervisor. 
                                    We settled on using 3 sensors in the project, ph, turbidity and soil moisture, as we found these were sufficient to monitor the 
                                    important elements of the hydroponic system. 2 of these sensors are analog therefore we would need to purchase Arduino to take 
                                    readings from these sensors. I have no experience with the Arduino board, this will be interesting. We also decided to borrow a 
                                    Raspberry Pi 3 from the department instead of purchasing one to reduce cost.

                                <p>Problems with ordering parts</p>
                                <p>Zane got into some issues when attempting to order the parts for the project. We are currently trying to determine
                                   what is the likely cause of the problem to fix it. I researched similar hydroponic projects utilizing the Pi and how 
                                   they implemented their system to help get some direction for ours. I also created the project folder in my 
                                   drive which will house all important documents and items related to the project that the Project supervisor has access to.
                                   We also changed the name of the project to PiFarm so it sounds like a marketable product that has something to do with 
                                   automation because it implies that a Raspberry Pi is involved. After porject lecture on 'Choosing the right database',
                                   we decided as a group that we would use Firebase as we require data to be managed in real time. Plus Zane and I had some 
                                   prior experience with it so this was good.

                                <p>Learnt about coding for the Arduino and that the mircocontroller does not stop executing whatever code is 
                                    uploaded to it. For now, I connected the Arduino to my personal laptop and uploaded the code. No interaction
                                    with the Pi and Arduino yet. 
                                    Using sample code from DFRobot website (the manufacturer), used the Arduino to take readings from the turbidity sensor.
                                    The following things were accomplished:<br>
                                    1) Used linear equation from DFRobot website for the turbidity sensor to convert the analog voltage read to NTU <br>
                                    2) Had to play with the trimmer on the sensor in order to get a stable reading from the sensor when it is inside the 
                                    plastic coating and one high enough to be read as high through the analog input pins on the Arduino uno <br>

                                    3) Adjusted linear equation to show the relationship between NTU and Voltage to reflect the reality of the sensor <br>

                                    Planning and filming for the mid-course video presentation was done. Could not show much implementation as all the sensors
                                    only arrived last week. While discussing project progress with Project Supervisor, the original API design to attempt to
                                    control the sensors was discarded due to the mircocontroller constantly running one program uploaded to it. Another approach was 
                                    discussed to utilize the database and automate the sensor readings instead.

                                <p>Calibration of the soil moisture sensor was done but I encounter problems when reading from the pH sensor. I got some buffer solution
                                    to test the pH sensor with but then realized the readings leaned to the more acidic side. My mom who is familiar with pH testing and 
                                    similar scientific instructments suggested that it was due to the storage solution it was packaged with. The 3 point calibration process
                                    was done using buffer solutions of pH 4,7 and 10 but the pH sensor failed to calibrate. I left the pH probe in the 7 pH solution
                                    for a while hoping to train the probe to get accurate readings.

                                    with more than 5 people. Group members cannot meet to assemble the project as Zane has the hydroponic setup which 
                                    includes the pump while I have all the rest of parts for the Embedded System. The code for the embedded system can still be developed 
                                    and Inzamam suggested I used something in place of the pump in the physical setup as the code to activate the pump will be the same.
                                    I decided I would use an LED in its place so it would light up to represent the pump turning on.

                                <p>The way the hardware components will all be connected was thought through and designed. Research into how to operate 
                                    the pump using the code was done with specific search using a relay module as this implementation was hinted to us by 
                                    a friend. Wrote code to send the soil moisture reading to a specific collection in the database using the collection ID.
                                    Also started to look into how to run multiple threads on the Arduino, turns out you cant! But you can implement something
                                    that resembles mutlithreading called protothreading.

                                <p>AVRDUDE</p>
                                <p> After being extremely frustrated the previous day, doing research into how to send the date from the RP3 to the arduino to set the clock, 
                                    at 5am I got it thankfully. <br>
                                    The research indicated and displayed sample code using an alternative language with its own IDE known as 'Processing' to wait for a response 
                                    from the arduino to send the date. After much frustration thinking I hit a wall, I sat down and walked through the code, which also gave a hint 
                                    how to send the utc time format using linux which is the pi's base. I wrote a python script to mimic what the processing script was doing in much 
                                    simplier terms and got it to work, now I can use that to check the time and run the sensors at particular times throughout the day. Thank God! 
                                    <br>
                                    Then while developing code and trying to achieve the protothreading using sample code so that I can use the concept to take readings from 
                                    both the pH and turbidity sensors, I kept getting these errors with avrdude at the prefix like avrdude: programmer not working or avrdude: attempt 5 in 10 ..... 
                                    These errors were preventing new code from being uploaded to the Arduino. Ofcourse I researched these errors and tried most of 
                                    what was suggested,even pressing the reset button (which is what they said to do) on the board several times but nothing is working right now
                                    so I'm going to give the Arduino a little break.

                                <p>The nightmare of querying the firebase database</p>
                                <p>Well........boyyyyyyyyy. What I thought would be my one of the simpliest jobs turned out to be one of the hardest. 
                                   Essentially, for the pump to activate, the python script checks the database for the most recent soil moisture reading, 
                                   i.e, check if the soil is wet or not as the soil moisture sensor takes digital signals. Getting the specific document 
                                   from the moisture collection within the users collection posed a great problem. All in all, when I started actually 
                                   figuring out what was happening, it went along the lines of the following because I cannot remember all the other things 
                                   I was trying and failing at. Sigh. Eventually I realized that I have been obtaining a generator object when running the query, 
                                   to which this was completely new to me so I had to research it a bit. I dont exactly know why it pulled a generator object or 
                                   the pulled data stored in a generator obtain especially when the query only returned one document (which I wanted to happen and 
                                   I iterated through the generator to make sure). From that I was able to pull what I wanted and finally move past this. Thank God.
                                   <br>
                                    I also solved the AVR problems occurring on the Arduino and was able to complete the code to take readings from 
                                    the ph and turbidity sensor using the concept of protothreading which turned out to be quite simple. <br>
                                    Having little background in physics, learning how to use the relay module and how to setup the wiring so that it circuit is normally open
                                    was quite fun as it was not something I had to practice before. It is quite easy so it was no accomplishment but enjoyable
                                    none the less understanding the role electricity plays in the hardware and following its flow to design the physical structure
                                    the embedded system <br>
                                    While Zane encountered problems hosting the web application, I was exploring the option of developing an API which will be 
                                    used by the python scripts on the Embedded System to get the userID of the current user logged in so that the code would
                                    update the specific user collection. I have not been able to completely implement this and has run into some problems.

                                <p>So close!</p>
                                <p>With the project deadline approaching quickly on the 11th, assignments now finishing for other courses and the API still not completed as I was encountering problems to post with
                                    the way the react app was built, I began to be a little concerned. Upon doing further research, I discovered that the API will still require 
                                    a database to keep the refresh tokens which would be used to get the user's ID to be sent to the embedded system when it make the API call.
                                    Since both the embedded system and the web app was already connected to a shared database, I decided to create a current user collection
                                    in the db which the web app will populate with the user ID that will be extracted from the user token it receives when the user is authenticated.
                                    Thankfully, I already knew how to query the database using python so I easily modified all the code scripts to retrieve most recently added
                                    user ID from the current user collection which I populated through my local copy of the web app. When I tested and ensured this approach worked
                                    to send the data to the specific user collection who is logged into the system, I informed Zane and we made the necessary changes to the web app
                                    in the code repo. <br>
                                    All scripts now final I scheduled the python scripts to be ran at particular times using cron <br>
                                    Now to tackle the final documentation, review previous documentation as design changes as been made as implementation was being 
                                    carried out and the final video presentation. Thankfully we got a 4 day extension so the project is now due on the 15th.

                                    While neating up code and running final tests before uploading to the github, I thought of a more efficent
                                    way to activate the pump than querying the user's collection for the latest soil moisture value. Before I was 
                                    attempting to keep the different functions separate from each other and I'm not sure when I didn't do this before
                                    but converted the original script which activated the pump to a module to be imported by the soil moisture script 
                                    and will only run when the soil moisture reading is low. I am sure there was a reason I decided to do it the way I did
                                    before but all that matters now is that I fixed it. 
                                    <br>
                                    Documentation, my least favourite part. This week was filled and focused around it. The group spent many hours on call,
                                    working together and helping out document lead Caro out to finish these documents and have it reflect our project in the 
                                    best we can. Zane also gave us the bad news that his word press will expire but as usual he already had a backup website ready
                                    for us to put our journal entries in. Its a good thing I kept my personal noteworthy points on my trello board! 
                                    <br>
                                    This project has been challenging to us Big Twigs especially because it did not particularly turn out like we wanted but it was a great 
                                    learning experience. Alot of hardwork was done and hours were spent trying to overcome our limitations and setbacks, particularly in light of 
                                    unique circumstances presented due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but most importantly, knowledge was gained and experienced was acquired. 
                                    I have not given up on embedded systems and I do plan on purchasing my own Raspberry Pi and working on personal projects in the future.
