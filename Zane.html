                                <p>So this is my first entry into my semester long journal for Project. I’m excited to get into things and get my hands
                                dirty building a web application with Gatsby.js, React.js and Firebase. After talking with Steffi and Carolyne this
                                week, we decided to do some research into the hardware components we need to actually build the application. At this
                                point we have no idea what the name for the application will be yet but I’m sure we’ll figure something out down the
                                road. Once we figure out what we need to get for the system, we’ll order the parts and have them shipped to us by the
                                first week in February. For the latest, maybe we’ll get some parts in mid February. We also decided that we would make
                                our journal entries at the end of every week just before we do the weekly report.</p>

                                <p>We ordered the parts last week so we expected them to arrive next week to begin development on the sensor components.
                                However, while checking on the status of my order on amazon, a strange thing happened. I wasn’t able to track my order
                                like I did before. I checked my email and saw that amazon had sent me an email during the day stating that there was an
                                issue with payment and consequently, they cancelled my order. This was very strange considering that this was a brand
                                new credit card I used to make the purchase and it was tied to my father’s business bank account. Scotiabank was
                                contacted to find out more information on the issue but unfortunately, their systems reported that no such transaction
                                had occurred on amazon, which was weird. I decided that I would use another credit card to make the purchase on amazon
                                so I will make a payment on my other card and reorder the parts. This week, we also discussed the website and planned
                                out our development process. We agreed to approach development with the React framework and Firebase Firestore to
                                incorporate real time updates in the application. We also did some research on other projects with similar
                                implementations to ours using the raspberry pi. This was primarily to see what sensors these projects included and the
                                APIs used to connect each of these sensors to the web application monitoring the system from the user’s phone. During
                                the week, we also came up with a fresh name for the project. So from this point onward, we’ve decided to call the
                                project “PiFarm”. We started and finished a decent amount of the Scope document this week as well and did more research
                                into React, Firebase and the hardware components we ordered previously to get some information on their usage for
                                implementation later down the road.</p>

                                <p>This week we finished off the Scope document for Project and also got a fair amount of research done on the hardware
                                components for the sensors. The information so far has been useful to point out what parts have been used well with each
                                other but so far, the articles and blogs we’ve gone into have excluded actual coding and development of the sensor
                                components. The problem with the bank continues to persist. As a result we still have not been able to make a purchase
                                of the hardware components. I have used both my Aero and Gold credit cards from Scotiabank but I still haven’t been able
                                to get my purchase in. I am considering using another bank card to make the purchase. Other than that, web development
                                has commenced. Using my knowledge of react from building some small projects over the vacation, I was able to draw up a
                                simple component tree showcasing the major components and sections of the application. I will construct a wireframe and
                                go even further into detail before I share my progress with Carolyne and Steffi though. For the next week, my focus will
                                be on pushing out the wireframe of the web application and to begin development using Gatsby. I will also focus on
                                researching APIs to help Steffi out since we may be running behind on time for development.</p>

                                <p>This week we started working on milestone 2 of the project, I’ve never had to work on timelines before but Carolyne said
                                she’ll handle it. Steffi and I just have to assist as best we can with the timeline and use cases, which shouldn’t be
                                too difficult. There still has been no progress with purchasing the parts. After speaking with the bank manager
                                operating the Scotiabank Marabella branch, we were able to determine that a shortage of USD currency in the bank was
                                behind the rejection of my purchases. From what she said, there was little even she could do to assist with the
                                situation. As a result, we must use a credit card from another bank. I am going to make a payment on my mother’s card
                                tomorrow or on Monday to get this over with because time is quickly running out on us. Web development right now is also
                                at a standstill since I haven’t broken the application down more than I did last week. This week in general was pretty
                                busy. I had to manage three events for the biological society while managing work for my other courses. I will
                                definitely tackle web development this weekend though.</p>

                                <p>Work continued on milestone 2 this week. We also did a bit more research into the hardware components needed to develop
                                the sensor components for the project. At this point we have been able to get bank clearance. The parts have been
                                ordered and we are awaiting their shipment to the country. This was made possible by Steffi who used her mom’s credit
                                card to pay for the parts for us. Pretty soon things will be hectic since we’re already at least two weeks behind on
                                development in the semester so far. The main thing though is that we have been able to do a fair amount of research so
                                we should be able to handle things well when the grind comes. I was able to get a decent bit of web development done as
                                well. I constructed a wireframe using Figma and during help desk this week, I shared the design for the website with
                                Steffi and Carolyne. They both like the design but it’s still a ways off from actually being developed. At this point, I
                                think I’m ready to be done with the web application and just be ready to help Steffi with the embedded system. I started
                                following some tutorials on youtube and udemy to help with my understanding of Gatsby. So far things have been good, but
                                there’s still a lot of things I don’t quite understand. I’m going to start working with a starter site later on in the
                                week to help speed up the production of the website.</p>

                                <p>So I forgot that Carnival was this week and since I don’t go to jump up like everybody else on Jouvert morning, I was
                                sent to visit some relatives in the bush. While I don’t mind visiting, the problem with having no wifi gets to me. On
                                top of that, I wasn’t able to work on the website like I’d planned at all. My consolation at least was that on Thursday
                                and Friday I was able to have the Biological Society’s office all to myself to work. Everybody is at home prepping for
                                exams next week and I’m here struggling with Gatsby at this point. Working with the starter sites has been more
                                troublesome than I originally thought. Firstly, I don’t know and have never worked with Typescript on an application.
                                Secondly, it is so difficult to find the content you’re looking to change on a starter site. I changed the logo image
                                three times on the Hero Blog starter site template I used the first time before it actually changed.This got me
                                frustrated so I tried a few other starter sites. The only problem with Gatsby starters is the feel I get from them right
                                now. They’re inflexible and remind me of a lot of wordpress themes unless you build the application yourself. I’ve gone
                                through 9% of 37 hours of content on the Gatsby tutorial course I have on udemy and my frustrations keep increasing.
                                Gatsby is nice and all, but at this point, it’s not about what I want. We’re behind schedule and I need a functional web
                                application so that I can help Steffi connect it to the sensor components when she is ready for it. The thought has come
                                to my mind to scrap the Gatsby project and build the website in React from scratch or if push really comes to shove,
                                build a static website in HTML, CSS and Javascript in one night and have it ready. We’ll see how it goes. I’m not about
                                to give up so easily so I’m going to allow myself a little more time on Gatsby before I switch to an alternative.</p>

                                <p>I’ve continued making some headway with Gatsby. I’ve created a nice interface for the user that isn’t too harsh on the
                                eyes. I’m still not exactly over my frustrations since a lot of things still don’t work as I’d like. The main thing at
                                least is that I’m getting somewhere. Some more research was done into sensor components, the arduino and connecting the
                                pi to the pump component. Other than this, nothing much has really happened this week with regards to the project. We
                                had some exams this week and we have exams next week as well. I had an exam for ISS three days ago and that alone was
                                worth 20%. On top of that, I had two exams for Web Tech this week but one of them was postponed till next week. Other
                                than this, I’ve been preoccupied planning nature week with the Biological Society. Since it is their biggest event of
                                the year and I am responsible for managing their funds, I can’t back out at all even though I’m swamped with work at
                                this point. I’ll try to do some work on a project this weekend but given that nature week is right around the corner, I
                                have no idea how much I’ll be able to get done. Aside from this though, parts have been coming in that we ordered.
                                Steffi has gone into work heavily with these parts with all the research that she’s done in the weeks prior.Given that
                                we still have exams, work on project may slow down though. Nature week next week is also gonna take all my time so I
                                know I’ll barely be able to get anything done. We’ll see how it goes.</p>

                                <p>Today marked the end of nature week hosted by the Biological Society and I couldn’t be happier. This week was
                                    so
                                    exhausting. I’ve had to open the event for the last 5 days from 8am and I’ve barely eaten much during the
                                    days of the
                                    event. I haven’t even been able to get work done for the last week as I keep knocking out as soon as I touch
                                    my bed at
                                    home. The main thing though is that we were able to get the Raspberry Pi from the department yesterday.
                                    Steffi can
                                    finally start connecting parts to each other and sending data to the database. I haven’t made any progress
                                    this week but
                                    tomorrow I’m going to tackle the database setup with Gatsby.</p>

                                <p>Over the course of the last weekend, the Government made an announcement closing campus until April 20th due to the
                                emergence of a case of Covid-19 in Trinidad. At this point in time, things are uncertain so I refrained from leaving the
                                house and focussed on the work I’d neglected over the last few weeks. This week, I spent the majority of my time coding
                                on the web application. It has been the most frustrating week of work on the application so far. Throughout development
                                of the Gatsby site, a number of plugins were added to the application to add functionality and styling. However,
                                problems arose with setting up Firebase with Gatsby. From the getgo on the plugin documentation for Firebase, things
                                didn’t exactly make much sense. The official documentation specified that the plugins would facilitate database access
                                in the application, however, the database was not the only tool we needed to incorporate from Firebase to completely
                                build the web app. We also needed authentication services to maintain user authentication tokens and possibly cloud
                                functions to enable admin privileges on the application if it was required. Since the real time functionality Firebase
                                offers was desired, and given my previous, pent up frustrations while working with the starter sites, we decided to
                                abandon the Gatsby site and focus solely on a React implementation with firebase.Since Gatsby was already built with
                                React anyways, this change was nothing difficult to carry out. In some instances, whole jsx files were copied to the new
                                project. Last Saturday, I was also able to completely construct a working prototype of a “Drip to Waste” hydroponic
                                system fit with complete irrigation and a ½ horsepower water pump to deploy nutrients. Preparation of milestone 3
                                documents also started this week.</p>

                                <p>A lot happened this week for project. We completed our midcourse presentation, which was actually quite fun. Carolyne
                                continued working on the implementation document and I focussed on the web application. Significant progress was made on
                                the web application over the last week. In addition to setting up the pages for the application and achieving the
                                functionality I desired from the app (unlike Gatsby) I was also able to make some headway with adding Firebase to the
                                react application after extensive research. This part was probably the most frustrating thing I had to deal with all
                                week. Firebase doesn’t have official documentation on connecting it’s API to React web applications. On top of that, I
                                had never used the Firebase npm package before to add Firebase to a web application so I was a bit lost. I had to follow
                                3 tutorials on youtube with Indian guys and a guy who had a Russian accent. Needless to say, I didn’t understand
                                anything they were saying but I followed their videos and was able to achieve the desired functionality after several
                                hours of trial and error. Perhaps, the one thing I didn’t expect at all in my development of the web application so far
                                was that a package would malfunction. While styling the web application, I came across a problem with styling which
                                resulted in the application behaving quite oddly. I removed styles and eventually a whole stylesheet, but nothing
                                worked. I had to remove a few packages from the application causing development to backtrack a bit because of this. The
                                main thing is that I kept version control handy on my local so it wasn’t hard to backtrack. Even so, this issue
                                definitely is troublesome. I’ll have to work around it and work with styling packages that are credible by developers.
                                Lastly, after speaking with Inzy in our weekly meetings, we came to the conclusion that we’d have to discard our design
                                ideas for API usage. I don’t fully understand the reason, but according to Steffi, the arduino component constantly runs
                                the code uploaded to it. Due to this, she settled on using the database as an alternative.</p>

                                <p>Due to Covid-19, the team members of Big Twigs can no longer meet up. Our meetings are online now and we are expected to
                                continue working on project at home. Styling on the web application has not been continued since last week. Firebase
                                functionality was added for authentication and some database features though. At this point, the web application is
                                almost done. All that remains is the styling and a few tweaks with Firebase tools to ensure it works properly. Steffi
                                continues to work on her end calibrating the sensor components. Soon she’ll need the web application so I’ve pushed out
                                the functionality and left the styling for last at this point. At this stage, she can begin working with the
                                application, however, the database functions need to be refactored a bit. At the beginning of the week, several errors
                                were encountered while working on the database and pulling data to the web app. Some of these issues were resolved, but
                                it required me going through Firebase documentation to find the right functions to use in the application. I also had to
                                do quite a bit of research on the useEffect react hook to get this database functionality operational. Carolyne
                                continues to work on the implementation document. I have other project deadlines approaching and I won’t be able to
                                solely focus on project for the next week.</p>

                                <p>The major issue I have right now is with authentication persistence. At this point I can create accounts, login and
                                logout. The problem is that when I login, if the page is refreshed, I’m required to login again. I need to find out how
                                to persist the authentication data until the user explicitly logs out of the app. I’ll be working on this throughout the
                                week. The last major setback we encountered for this week is that we won’t be able to fully assemble the entire system.
                                The situation with Covid has left us quarantined. As a result, Steffi and I can’t meet to connect parts to the
                                hydroponics system and the pump. The compromise we’re working on for this is to have an led light indicate when the pump
                                has been triggered.</p>

                                encountered. The first being that there were issues with pushing to the git repository from the command line. After
                                extensive research, a solution was found. We were also able to get the application hosted on github pages. Work
                                continued on other aspects of the web application in the meantime. I also began styling the application again.</p>

                                <p>Over the last few days, we’ve encountered a number of problems with regard to project. With the web application, the
                                most notable problem pertained to hosting a production build of the application on github. Over the last 10 days, a lot
                                of progress was made including the persistence problem. This was solved using a react hook known as the useContect hook
                                after extensive research. Styling also tool off quite a bit but a minor problem with a package installed called
                                reactstrap hindered further development. As a result, it was removed and another package called emotion was installed to
                                style the application instead. Steffi has also been having a lot of noteworthy problems as of late. Even though she
                                hasn’t had problems with the web app so far more and more problems have been showing up with regard to the sensor
                                components she’s working on. I hope she can figure it out soon.</p>

                                problem that continues to persist ,however, is with hosting. I’ve tried hosting on Github, Heroku and Firebase at this
                                point but nothing works, The build always breaks which makes no sense since no errors appear in the console showing an
                                issue. As a result the hosting may be left out entirely. We’ll have to see if this happens or not. Testing begins for
                                the web application next week. Documentation for the final report is being assembled at this point.</p>

                                <p>I got an email today reminding me of my subscription for my wordpress hosting account. Apparently, my subscription for
                                the next year amounts to $400 USD which is absolute nonsense since I only maintain one domain name on my account. This
                                is problematic as I will not be able to maintain the journal site for our journals before my hosting account expires on
                                wordpress. As a result, I’m going to build the site from scratch and host it on github. This will keep me preoccupied
                                since we have a little break until the 11th for project. As a result, I will focus on just assembling a quick site to
                                add our journals to and working on documentation. Milestone 3 was also completed this week.</p>

                                <p>We got a 4 day extension on project last week Friday and it has been hectic. We’ve had quite a but to do to prepare for
                                submission. In addition to the final report, we’ve had to assemble a video presentation and this meant making a script
                                and of course, find memes that would fit perfectly into the presentation. We spent quite a bit of time on calls together
                                over the last week spending some seven hour days working on diagrams we’d previously done and going back over
                                documentation. It has been tough but project so far has been great, despite all the setbacks. It was a lot of hardwork
                                and reminded me of the days when I grinded for CAPE while doing 8 subjects. It was fun and even though the project
                                wasn’t completed the way we wanted, I very much intend to see it through so that I can automate my own hydroponics
